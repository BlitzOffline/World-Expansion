This is the source code for the PlaceholderAPI expansion https://api.extendedclip.com/expansions/world/

Note: For placeholders which has the argument <world>, you can name argument to the specific world, or symbol "$" (without ") as local world
For Vault-related placeholders, especially %world_<world>_players_<group>% and %world_<world>_totalBalance%, you need to have both Vault & one of economy provider plugin (Ex: EssentialsX) to work
