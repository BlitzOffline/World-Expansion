This is the source code for the PlaceholderAPI expansion https://api.extendedclip.com/expansions/world/

**FORMAT CHANGED!** As of version 1.1.0, this expansion has completely changed its format. For the full format changes, look at the link above

Note: 
   + For placeholders which has the argument \<world\>, you can name the argument to the specific world, or symbol "$" (without ") as local world
   + For Vault-related placeholders, especially %world_players\_\<group\>\_\<world\>\% and %world_totalbalance\_\<world>\%, you need to have both Vault & one of economy provider plugin (e.g: EssentialsX) to work
